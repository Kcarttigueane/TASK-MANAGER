# EpyTodo

## Warning :warning:

I want to specify that for this project, \
I was a beginner in programming.\
Moreover, I had never used JavaScript,\

## Description :sunrise_over_mountains:

The project idea is to build a Todo List. \
Thanks to it, you’ll be able to handle all the tasks you need to do easily! \
We will mainly focus on the “backend” side of the project,\
Within this project, you’ll have to develop:\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. your MySQL database.\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A web server using Node.js


Here is the architecture I set up for the project :

We also made a SQL script to create the database quickly :

## Start project :checkered_flag:

You can use curl to perform your queries afterwards \
or use the repository's postman collection which has all possible queries

## Bonus :package:

As a bonus, I have created a postman collection that allows you to test all the requests of the project,\
feel free to use it if you need it.
